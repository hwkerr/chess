Current: move history navigation (I fixed a bug in chessboardjsx, waiting for maintainer to update on npm)

Show legal move indicators when dragging a piece

Move History
- allow move navigation
    - keyboard arrow-keys change the selected move in the Move History
    - keyboard 0 goes to first position in history
    - user can see an earlier board position by selecting a different move in the Move History

Add status indicators
- check
- checkmate
- stalemate
- highlight capturable pieces differently
