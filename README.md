# Chess App

As I continue to develop this app, I hope to work towards building a fully functioning chess board like what is available on Chess.com or lichess.org
and eventually add some new features of my own.
I would like to give credit to the following npm packages that I've been able to use in this project:

React,
Chessboard.jsx,
Chess.js,
use-sound,
Material-UI,
cm-pgn
